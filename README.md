### Sidebar overlay instead of push

Make the sidebar overlap the viewport content with a single class:

```html
<body class="sidebar-overlay">
  ...
</body>
```

This will keep the content stationary and slide in the sidebar over the side content. It also adds a `box-shadow` based outline to the toggle for contrast against backgrounds, as well as a `box-shadow` on the sidebar for depth.

It's also available for a reversed layout when you add both classes:

```html
<body class="layout-reverse sidebar-overlay">
  ...
</body>
```

### Sidebar open on page load

Show an open sidebar on page load by modifying the `<input>` tag within the `sidebar.html` layout to add the `checked` boolean attribute:

```html
<input type="checkbox" class="sidebar-checkbox" id="sidebar-checkbox" checked>
```

Using Liquid you can also conditionally show the sidebar open on a per-page basis. For example, here's how you could have it open on the homepage only:

```html
<input type="checkbox" class="sidebar-checkbox" id="sidebar-checkbox" {% if page.title =="Home" %}checked{% endif %}>
```
