<h3 id="About Me">About Me</h3>

<p><b>SITE UNDER CONSTRUCTION</b></p>

<p> I am an incoming PhD Student in the  <a href= "https://stat.uw.edu"> Department of Statistics at the University of Washington </a>. <br>
Previously, I studied Applied Mathematics with a Concentration in Data Science at the University of California, Berkeley. </p>

<p>Currently, I am interested in machine learning and its specific use towards sequenced datasets in real-world applications. 
  I became familiar with the topic through natural language processing, but my interest has evolved to include various kinds of signals and time series. 
  I am working towards a career in industry, so I hope to pursue research and professional opportunities that involve this subject.</p>

<p>Outside of school and research, I enjoy photography, electronic music, and origami.</p>
