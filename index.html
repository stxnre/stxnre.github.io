<h3 id="About Me">About Me</h3>

<p> I am a PhD Student in the  <a href= "https://stat.uw.edu"> Department of Statistics at the University of Washington </a>. <br>
Previously, I studied Applied Mathematics with a Concentration in Data Science at the University of California, Berkeley. </p>

<p>I am interested in causal inference and its applications in analyzing dependent data (like time series), 
  as well as the applicability of machine learning in the field.</p>

<p>Outside of school and research, I enjoy photography, electronic music, and origami.
  In <a href = "https://stxnre.github.io/photo" >Photo Section</a>, you can take a look at some photos I take.
